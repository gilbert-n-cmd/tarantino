# Consistency Edits for HTML Files

## Plan Overview
- Standardize HTML structure: doctype, html lang, head meta, title, CSS links
- Standardize header, nav, footer across all files
- Move inline CSS to style.css where possible
- Standardize scripts and inline JS
- Change all references to "Noble Mayombo Seed Secondary School", "Kahinju", "Kayingi", or "Noble" to "Bishop Angelo Tarantino Memorial Secondary School"
- Fix typos and inconsistencies (e.g., "SChool" to "School")
- Ensure consistent indentation and formatting
